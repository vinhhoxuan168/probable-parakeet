# Database Performance & Query Optimization

## MANDATORY RULES — READ FIRST

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Skipping any of them is a review failure.**

1. You MUST produce a COMPLETE Index Verification Table for EVERY column in JOIN ON and WHERE clauses — not just the ones you suspect are missing indexes. A partial table is unacceptable.
2. You MUST produce a COMPLETE Join Analysis Table for EVERY join when 4+ tables are involved.
3. You MUST explicitly check each item in the Completeness Checklist (Section 10) and include the filled checklist in your review output.
4. You MUST use the structured output format (Section 9) for every issue. No free-form paragraphs.
5. You MUST flag client-side aggregation that should be done in SQL as a separate issue with its own severity.

## 1. Detect Index Usage — Systematic Cross-Check

When reviewing code that includes SQL queries, Hybris FlexibleSearch, or ORM calls (TypeORM, Prisma, SQLAlchemy, Hibernate):

- **Requirement**: Any new query must use `Index Seek` or `Index Scan` on a limited range. Full `Index Scan` or `Table Scan` on large tables is prohibited.
- **Mandatory Step — Index Verification Table**: For **every** JOIN condition and **every** WHERE filter column in the query, produce a verification table. **You must list ALL columns, not just the problematic ones.** The table must be COMPLETE — a review that only flags 1 column out of 15+ is considered incomplete.

| Column | Table | Has Index? | Index Name | Source File |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|-------------|
| `{p.status}` | IS32Promotion | Yes | statusIdx | is32core-items.xml |
| `{p.redeemDigitalCoupon}` | IS32Promotion | **No** | — | is32core-items.xml |
| `{pt.elabPromotionDisplayType}` | IS32PromotionTag | ? | — | requires verification |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

  **You MUST list every single column** — not just the ones that are missing indexes. Scan **all** `*-items.xml` files in the repository to populate this table. For Hybris built-in types (e.g., `Coupon`, `Product`, `Customer`, `CouponRedemption`), note whether the join column is a known indexed attribute (e.g., `Product.code`, `Coupon.couponId`) or flag it as "requires verification — built-in type".

- **Detection**: Flag any column used in a JOIN ON or WHERE clause that does NOT appear in an index.
- **Composite Index Check**: When a WHERE clause filters on 2+ columns simultaneously (e.g., `status = ? AND suspended = ? AND startDate <= ? AND endDate > ?`), check whether a composite index covers the full filter combination. If only partial indexes exist, recommend a composite index covering the most selective column combination. **Explicitly state the recommended composite index column order** (most selective column first).
- **Both Sides of JOIN**: Always verify indexes on BOTH sides of a JOIN condition. A missing index on either side can cause a full scan on that table.

## 2. Slow Response Patterns

Flag the following patterns as "Potential Slow Performance":

- **Leading Wildcards**: Using `LIKE '%keyword'` (causes full scan).
- **Functions in WHERE**: Using functions on indexed columns (e.g., `WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2023`) which prevents index usage.
- **N+1 Queries**: Detecting loops that execute a database query inside each iteration. Also detect DAO methods returning raw data (e.g., `List<List<Object>>`, `List<Object[]>`) that callers are likely to iterate and re-query. If a DAO method returns raw denormalized data without aggregation, flag it as an N+1 risk and recommend either aggregating in SQL or providing a higher-level method.
- **Mismatched Data Types**: Comparing a string column with a numeric value (causes implicit conversion and ignores index).
- **Unbounded Result Set (CRITICAL)**: Flag any query that does NOT have a `LIMIT`, pagination (`setMaxResults`, `setStart`), or row-count cap. Queries joining 3+ tables without pagination can produce millions of rows and cause OOM. **This is an automatic CRITICAL severity issue — no exceptions.**
- **Cartesian Product / JOIN Explosion**: When using LEFT JOIN, flag if the join can multiply the result set (e.g., a LEFT JOIN on a one-to-many relationship without aggregation). Especially dangerous when multiple LEFT JOINs are chained. **Quantify the explosion**: estimate the multiplication factor (e.g., "if a Coupon has 1000 CouponRedemptions, each row before this JOIN produces 1000 rows after").
- **Large Intermediate Result Sets**: When a query joins many tables, verify that the join order and filters reduce row counts early. JOINs should be ordered so that the most restrictive filters apply first. **Produce a Row Estimation Chain** showing the estimated row count at each join step (see Section 6).
- **Client-side Aggregation (HIGH)**: If the query returns denormalized rows and a code comment or javadoc states that the caller must aggregate (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT, DISTINCT) in Java, this is a separate HIGH severity issue. Aggregation MUST be done in SQL. Loading millions of rows into JVM heap to aggregate in Java wastes memory, CPU, and network I/O.
- **IS NULL OR pattern distinction**: The pattern `(col IS NULL OR col <= ?date)` is a standard nullable-date guard and is generally NOT a performance concern — do NOT flag this as an OR-clause issue. Only flag OR clauses where both branches reference different columns or use different operators that prevent a single index scan, such as `p.code = :code OR p.code LIKE :prefix || '%'`.

## 3. JAVA RUNTIME EXCEPTION

Scan for **concrete, triggerable** runtime errors only:

- **Null dereference (NPE)**:
  - Field injected via setter without null-check at usage point (e.g., `flexibleSearchService` set via `setFlexibleSearchService()` but used directly without guard)
  - Method parameters not validated before dereferencing (e.g., `customer.getPk()` called without checking `customer != null`)
  - Return values from framework calls that may return null (e.g., `SearchResult.getResult()` may return null — check for null before calling `.isEmpty()`)
- **Unsafe cast**
- **`Optional.get()` without presence check**
- **Collection access without size/bound checks**
- **Illegal or invalid state in runtime flow**

Flag issues only when a **real execution path** exists.
Avoid speculative or "might happen" warnings.

**Important**: Do NOT skip this section even when the primary focus of the review is on query performance. Every Java file must be scanned for runtime exceptions.

## 4. MEMORY LEAK & MEMORY GROWTH

Scan for long-lived memory retention:

- **Static references holding runtime objects**
- **Listeners or callbacks not released**
- **`ThreadLocal` not cleared**
- **Unbounded collections or caches without eviction**
- **Promotion context retaining large objects across executions**
- **Large query results loaded entirely into heap**: Methods returning `List<List<Object>>` or `List<Model>` from multi-table JOINs without pagination. If the result set is unbounded, this is effectively an OOM risk under production load. Recommend streaming (`ScrollableResults`), batching, or adding `setMaxResults()`.

Flag only when objects outlive their expected lifecycle.
Explain why GC cannot reclaim them and how to fix it.

**Important**: Do NOT skip this section even when the primary focus of the review is on query performance. Every Java file must be scanned for memory issues.

## 5. QUERY PATTERN & INDEX REGISTRY

**Unified registry of all query patterns, index rules, and table constraints.** Cross-check every query against these tables during review.

**To add new rules**: append a row to the relevant table. For patterns, set Scope to `any` for generic rules or to the specific table name for project-specific rules.

### 5.1 Slow & Forbidden Query Patterns

Flag any query matching these patterns. Generic patterns (`any`) apply to all tables; project-specific patterns apply only to the listed table(s).

| # | Pattern (SQL snippet) | Scope | Severity | Issue | Required Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `FORMAT(col, ...) = ?` / `YEAR(col) = ?` | any | HIGH | Function on indexed column → index bypassed | Use date range: `>= ? AND < ?` |
| 2 | `LOWER(col) = LOWER(?)` | any | HIGH | Function on indexed column → index bypassed | Use CI collation or computed column |
| 3 | `CAST(col AS VARCHAR) = ?` | any | HIGH | Implicit type conversion → index bypassed | Match column's native data type |
| 4 | `SUBSTRING(CONVERT(...), ...) = ?` | any | HIGH | Nested functions → index bypassed | Use range comparison |
| 5 | `col1 = ? OR col2 = ?` (different columns) | any | MEDIUM | OR across columns → no single index | Split into UNION or restructure |
| 6 | `col = ? OR col LIKE ?%` | any | MEDIUM | OR with LIKE → prevents index seek | Split into UNION |
| 7 | `WHERE merchantCode = ?` (no date filter) | `is32loyaltytransaction` (50M) | CRITICAL | Low cardinality (~200 values) → ~250K rows | Add `transactionDate` range filter |
| 8 | `JOIN LoyaltyCard ↔ LoyaltyTransaction` (no date range) | `is32loyaltycard` + `is32loyaltytransaction` | CRITICAL | 1 card × 5K+ txn → explosive join; all cards → OOM | Add `transactionDate` range |
| 9 | `WHERE status = ?` only | `is32fulfillmententry` (20M) | HIGH | 7 values → ~2.8M rows/status; low selectivity | Add date or `orderCode` filter |
| 10 | `FORMAT(createdDate)` / `YEAR(createdDate)` in WHERE | `is32returnrequest` (8M) | HIGH | Bypasses `returnCreatedDateIdx` (see #1) | Use `>= ?start AND < ?end` |
| 11 | `SELECT *` | `is32loyaltytransaction` (50M) | CRITICAL | `description` LONG_STRING → massive I/O | Specify needed columns only |
| 12 | `LEFT JOIN` (without `transactionDate` range) | `is32loyaltytransaction` (50M) | CRITICAL | Unbounded intermediate result on 50M rows | Use INNER JOIN + date filter |
| 13 | SUM/COUNT/GROUP BY/DISTINCT in Java | `is32loyaltytransaction` | HIGH | Raw rows in JVM heap → OOM risk | Aggregate in SQL (see Section 2) |
| 14 | `JOIN ... ON orderCode` (no filters on both sides) | `is32returnrequest` + `is32fulfillmententry` | CRITICAL | Both high-volume, no `orderCode` index → Cartesian | Add status/date filters on both sides |
| 15 | `LIKE '%keyword%'` on `description` | `is32loyaltytransaction` (50M) | CRITICAL | LONG_STRING full scan on 50M rows | Use search index or exact match |

### 5.2 High-Volume Table Registry

Any query touching these tables MUST comply with the corresponding constraints:

| Table | Estimated Rows | Constraint |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| `is32loyaltytransaction` | ~50M | MUST include `transactionDate` range filter. Unbounded queries → automatic CRITICAL. |
| `is32fulfillmententry` | ~20M | MUST include date range OR specific `orderCode` filter. `status` alone is prohibited (7 distinct values → full scan). |
| `is32returnrequest` | ~8M | MUST NOT join with `is32fulfillmententry` without WHERE filters on BOTH sides. Unfiltered join → ~160B rows. |
| `is32loyaltycard` | ~5M | `customerId` filter requires index. `LOWER()` or functions on `email` bypass indexes. |
| `is32warehouseallocation` | ~2M | `productCode` join requires index — verify before allowing. |

### 5.3 Missing Index Registry

Columns confirmed to lack indexes. Any query using these in WHERE or JOIN ON triggers the listed severity:

| # | Table | Column | Estimated Rows | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `is32loyaltytransaction` | `cardNumber` | 50M | CRITICAL |
| 2 | `is32fulfillmententry` | `orderCode` | 20M | CRITICAL |
| 3 | `is32returnrequest` | `orderCode` | 8M | HIGH |
| 4 | `is32returnrequest` | `customerUid` | 8M | HIGH |
| 5 | `is32fulfillmententry` | `customerUid` | 20M | HIGH |
| 6 | `is32loyaltytransaction` | `storeId` | 50M | HIGH |

### 5.4 Required Composite Indexes

If a query uses the listed column combination without a matching composite index, flag it:

| Table | Column Combination | Required Index | Reason |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| `is32fulfillmententry` | `orderCode` + `status` | `fulfillOrderStatusIdx` | Most common fulfillment lookup. |
| `is32fulfillmententry` | `warehouseCode` + `status` + `createdDate` | `fulfillWarehouseStatusDateIdx` | Warehouse pending-entry queries. |
| `is32loyaltytransaction` | `cardNumber` + `transactionDate` | `txnCardDateIdx` | Standard txn history lookup. |
| `is32returnrequest` | `orderCode` + `returnStatus` | `returnOrderStatusIdx` | Most common return query pattern. |
| `is32returnrequest` | `customerUid` + `returnStatus` | `returnCustomerStatusIdx` | Customer return status queries. |
| `is32loyaltycard` | `tierCode` + `status` | `cardTierStatusIdx` | Tier migration and reporting queries. |

## 6. MULTI-TABLE JOIN REVIEW PROTOCOL

When a query joins 4 or more tables, apply the following additional checks:

- **Join Count Threshold**: Queries joining 6+ tables require an explicit justification in the review. Suggest breaking into smaller queries or using a materialized/cached view if the join count exceeds 8.
- **Mandatory Join Analysis Table**: For EVERY join in the query, produce the following table. **This is not optional — a review without this table for 4+ table queries is incomplete.**

| Step | Join | Type | Cardinality | Estimated Rows After | Filter Applied? |
|------|------|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | IS32Promotion AS p | driving table | — | ~10K (filtered by status, suspended, dates) | Yes (WHERE) |
| 2 | JOIN IS32PromotionTag AS pt | INNER | 1:1 | ~10K | Yes (displayType) |
| 3 | JOIN Coupon AS c | INNER | 1:1 | ~10K | No |
| 4 | LEFT JOIN CouponRedemption AS cr | LEFT | 1:N (**explosion**) | ~10K × N redemptions | **No filter — risk** |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

  For each row, state:
  - **Type**: INNER or LEFT
  - **Cardinality**: 1:1, 1:N, or N:M
  - **Estimated Rows After**: How the row count changes after this join
  - **Filter Applied?**: Whether any WHERE or ON condition reduces rows at this step

- **Row Estimation Chain**: Based on the Join Analysis Table, provide a narrative explanation of how rows grow or shrink through the query. Example: "Starting with ~10K active promotions, after LEFT JOIN CouponRedemption (1:N with avg 50 redemptions per coupon), rows explode to ~500K. This is then further multiplied by IS32Bucket (1:N)..."

- **Filter Pushdown**: Verify that WHERE conditions are applied to the driving table (first table in FROM) to reduce the initial scan early. Filters that only apply to the last-joined table force the database to scan and join everything first. **Specifically check**: are there WHERE conditions that could be moved into JOIN ON clauses to filter earlier?
- **SELECT Column Analysis**: Flag `SELECT *` or selecting columns from all joined tables when only a subset is needed. Unnecessary columns increase I/O and memory usage.
- **Missing Aggregation (HIGH)**: If the query returns denormalized rows that the Java code must aggregate (e.g., GROUP BY in comments but not in query), this is a HIGH severity issue. Recommend moving aggregation to the database with a concrete SQL example showing the GROUP BY / COUNT / SUM that should be added.
- **Query Decomposition Strategy**: When recommending breaking a large query into smaller ones, provide a concrete decomposition plan. Example: "Query 1: Get active promotion IDs with their reward configs. Query 2: For each promotion, get coupon redemption count. Query 3: Get e-stamp tier thresholds." Do not just say "break it up" — show HOW.

## 7. QUERY EXECUTION PERFORMANCE DEEP DIVE

Apply this section to every query that involves 3+ tables or is expected to run frequently (e.g., called per-request, per-customer, or in a scheduled job).

### 7.1 Connection & Transaction Impact
- **Long-running query risk**: Estimate whether this query could hold a database connection for an extended time. Queries with unbounded result sets or 8+ table joins can hold connections for seconds or more, exhausting the connection pool under load.
- **Transaction scope**: Check if the DAO method runs inside a transaction. A long-running read query inside a write transaction can cause lock contention.
- **Recommendation**: For read-only queries, recommend `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` or equivalent to avoid unnecessary locking.

### 7.2 Caching Opportunities
- **Identify cacheable queries**: If the query parameters include slowly-changing data (e.g., `catalogVersion`, `status = ACTIVE`), recommend caching the result with a TTL.
- **Hybris-specific**: For FlexibleSearch, recommend `FlexibleSearchQuery.setCacheable(true)` when the data changes infrequently and the result set is small.
- **Anti-pattern**: Do NOT recommend caching for queries with user-specific parameters (e.g., `userPk`) unless combined with a per-user cache strategy.

### 7.3 Concurrency & Scalability
- **Concurrent execution**: Estimate what happens if this query is executed concurrently by 100+ users. Will the database experience lock contention, connection pool exhaustion, or temp table overflow?
- **Scaling bottleneck**: If the query performs a full scan or large join, flag it as a horizontal scaling bottleneck — adding more app servers will increase database load linearly.

### 7.4 Hybris FlexibleSearch Specific
- **`setResultClassList` correctness**: Verify that the result class list matches the SELECT columns in order and type. Mismatches cause `ClassCastException` at runtime.
- **`setNeedTotal(false)`**: For queries where the total count is not needed, recommend `fsQuery.setNeedTotal(false)` to avoid an extra COUNT query.
- **Pagination with FlexibleSearch**: When recommending pagination, use `fsQuery.setStart(offset)` and `fsQuery.setCount(pageSize)`. Provide a concrete code example.
- **Type-safe results**: Flag methods returning `List<List<Object>>` or `List<Object[]>` when a typed DTO or Model would be safer. Raw Object lists are error-prone and make caller code fragile.

## 8. REVIEW OUTPUT FORMAT

To ensure reviews are actionable, every issue MUST follow this exact format. **Do NOT use free-form paragraphs.** Every issue gets its own block:

```
### [SEVERITY: Critical/High/Medium] — Short title

**Location**: file:line or query line reference
**Issue**: Concrete description of what is wrong
**Evidence**: Reference to *-items.xml index definition, code line, or query pattern
**Impact**: What happens in production (e.g., "Full table scan on 10M-row Product table causing 30s response time under 100 concurrent users")
**Fix**: Specific actionable recommendation with code example if applicable
```

**Rules**:
- Do NOT produce vague warnings like "this query may be slow" without specifying which join/filter is the problem, which index is missing, and what the fix is.
- Do NOT combine multiple issues into one block. Each issue gets its own severity and block.
- **Impact must be quantified** where possible: estimate table sizes, row multiplication factors, or memory consumption. "Millions of rows" is better than "many rows". "500MB heap consumed loading 2M rows of 4 columns" is better than "high memory usage".
- **Fix must include code** for Critical and High issues. A textual description alone is insufficient.

## 9. SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION GUIDE

Use the following to determine severity. Do not downgrade severity for convenience.

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Causes outage, data loss, or OOM in production | Unbounded result set on 8+ table join; missing index on JOIN column of a 10M+ row table; SQL injection |
| **HIGH** | Significant performance degradation or runtime crash | NPE on common code path; client-side aggregation of large result sets; Cartesian product; missing null-check on framework return value |
| **MEDIUM** | Suboptimal performance or code quality concern | PII logging; missing composite index for multi-column filter; query not cached when it could be; missing `@Transactional(readOnly=true)` |
| **LOW** | Minor improvement opportunity | Naming conventions; missing javadoc; unused import |

**Escalation rule**: If an issue combines two categories (e.g., unbounded result set + client-side aggregation), use the HIGHER severity.

## 10. REVIEW COMPLETENESS CHECKLIST
